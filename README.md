# Wire_rope_isolators
 Documents related to the final project made at SUPMECA about wire rope isolators. 

 Aim of the project:

 -Characterization of the isolator: obtain the hysteresis cycle using a shaker, varying amplitude and frequency of oscillations to investigate non-linear effects;
 
 -Test of a configuration: analyse the behaviour of a real application (isolation of a payload from ground excitation) using a vibrating table
